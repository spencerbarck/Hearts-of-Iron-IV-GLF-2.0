 glf.13.d:0 "The operation to free the former chief of the Confederation is ready. Tribes friendly to us living in Canadaian territory have sheltered our most elite soldiers, these brave warriors will face insurmountable odds assaulting the prison and escaping with the dark chief. For weeks of planning military strategists have debated the best way to get the chief back across the border, they have decided that while it may be risky a seaplane will be stationed nearby and if ishkode is freed from his prison he will be airlifted back to our borders. If this mission fails we will likely never get a second chance and our relations with Canada will further sour."

The Canadians have asked us to allow them to conduct search parties in the area. These search parties would have free reign to go across our borders, we would have to provide escorts to ensure that nobody ventures where they don’t belong. Alternatively we could conduct the search ourselves or ignore this request."

The bodies have been returned to the Canadaians but the body of the teenager Jacques Dextrax has not been found. An investigation into the matter has been opened to try to find the tribesmen who did this.

In a private meeting with the Chief of the Confederation, Ahanu brought with him a familiar face, a Canadian boy who was lost years ago. Jacques Dextrax was wearing traditional Chippewa war garbs and looked almost like a Chippewa himself. Ahanu admitted that he was leading a small fishing party through the boundary waters many years ago and they were fired on by Canadian trespassers. Several members of his party were shot and they returned fire killing all the Candians except for Jacques who now goes by Maple-Fox. Jacques was captured and taken to a secluded village, for the past few years he has lived among the Chippewa and learned the ways of the tribes. Maple-Fox has become a hardworking member of the Confederation and he attended millitary training in Canada before he was captured. Ahanu says that Maple-Fox is ready to command some forces of his own. If he is allowed to join our forces Maple-Fox may be a great asset to us."

 glf.21.d:0 "Today caravans of trucks and buses arrived unexpectedly in cities along the border between the United States and the Confederation. The caravans stopped and let out thousands of Apache people before quickly driving away. This is not the first time this has happened, several times throughout the history of the Confederation the United States have relocated tribes from their land to ours. Many United States officials believe it is best for these people to live in the Confederation rather than reservations in U.S occupied lands. The Confederation is a haven for these displaced people but this is not their true home and everytime we accept them it gives the United States more of a mandate to displace tribes."

One says that Canadian troops have tried to cross a bridge into our lands and have been shot at by concerned hawkists another says that hawkists crossed the border into Canadian lands and tried to claim the land for the Confederation. The truth is most likely somewhere in between these two reports. The hawkist involved are being made into heroes across the Confederation and Canadian officials have asked the chief of the Confederation to address the incident."

 glf.24.d:0 "Today in a truly terrible turn of events the Confederation trade ship the Sturgeon was fired on by a Canadian destroyer. The massive freighter was sunk in a matter of minutes as all but three of it’s crew of twenty seven were lost. The Canadians claim that the destroyer fired accidentally and it’s crew were poorly instructed but many tribal leaders across the Confederation have called this an act of war. Some still hope that this incident can be resolved peacefully and the Canadian have offered full cooperation in any investigation we wish to have."

 glf.26.d:0 "The Laker observers have arrived in the city of Barcelona today. They will begin their trip to the frontline soon and will meet with soldiers and generals from the Republican side as they try to take notes to send back to the Confederation. The initial writings of the observers say that there is an air of both anger and sadness among the people of Spain as the country tears itself apart. It is a surprise to see the same country that sent Crisotpher Columbius to bring the old world to the new descend into such acts of chaos. It is important to remember that golden ages end and if the Confederation is to survive we must stand together."

She began in a small airstrip next to Manitoba and ended on the shores of Lake Ontario. Her piloting skills rival that of  American aviators like Charles Lindburg and Amilia Earhart. Even after this great feat Honovi is a controversial figure, she is an outspoken hawkist and the daughter of the dark chief himself ishkode. The eyes of the Confederation are on it’s chief as they wait to see if Honovi will be honored."

 glf.96.d:0 "Messages from the Navajo tribe in the U.S state of Arizona have been coming in for about a week now. The Confederation keeps in contact with many tribes in the U.S and Canada both openly and secretly and the Navajo are one of those tribes. The Navajo say that many of their tribesmen have been offered job opportunities mining strange rocks for a mysterious company called Union Mines Development Corporation. Men tell stories of yellow rocks that were treated like gold. Our scientists have a hypothesis, this yellow dirt that the Navajo are finding may indeed be Uranium ore and this company called Union Mines Development Corporation may actually be the United States Army looking for material to build an atomic bomb. According to our scientist these Navajo miners may unknowingly be in danger of radiation exposure."

For weeks of planning military strategists have debated the best way to get the chief back across the border, they have decided that while it may be risky a seaplane will be stationed nearby and if ishkode is freed from his prison he will be airlifted back to our borders.

The explosion disabled his vehicle and killed the driver but Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh was left unscathed. The assassin was caught by local tribal police later that day trying to flee the city. It appears that the would-be assassin was a dockyard worker who had hawkist leanings. It is not clear if this man acted alone or was part of a larger hawkist cell. Due to the incident the Chief has cancelled his tour of the North Shore."

During his visit to Duluth Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh was traveling up the Park Point area of the city when a man next to the street shouted we will not be gentle and threw at the motorcade. The explosion killed Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh instantly and also injured the Chief of the Fond du Lac band. The assassin was caught by local tribal police later that day trying to flee the city. It appears that the would-be assassin was a dockyard worker who had hawkist leanings. It is not clear if this man acted alone or was part of a larger hawkist cell. Chief Tashunka of the Dekota tribe was chosen to be Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh’s successor. Tashunka was formerly the Chief of the Dekota tribe but he was exiled by the United States. It is yet to be seen if Tashunka’s rule will be anything like Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh’s."

Bugonaygeshig never gave an inch of land to the invaders and protected the Confederation from further territorial loss. Bugonaygeshig was also the first chief of the Confederation to come from the Ojibwe, ever since he stepped down and gave power to ishkode the Confederation has had only Ojibwe chiefs. Bugonaygeshig lived to the very old age of 98 and had four children and dozens of grandchildren."

At 4:20 PM the Honeymoon bridge crossing over the Niagara river collapsed, there were about a dozen cars on the bridge at the time and it appears that seven people perished in the incident. Many across the Confederation are outraged as it appears there were signs that the bridge was failing for weeks and these signs were ignored.

The Canadians have agreed to a joint investigation of the matter and have concluded that a sailor on the Sturgeon started to fire on the Canadian destroyer and the destroyer felt threatened and returned fire. Evidence was found that a crew member of the Sturgeon brought a heavy machine gun with him on his voyage. When the Candian destroyer passed by the ship he opened fire.
