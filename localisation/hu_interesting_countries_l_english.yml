 GLF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Lakes Confederation of tribes is isolated, landlocked, and divided. During the Great War chief Ishkode attacked Canada and the United States, a bloodless coup ended the hawkist regime of Ishkode and replaced him with his peaceful brother Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh. Ishkode was imprisoned in Canada and Canadian companies now take resources from tribal lands as part of the peace treaty. \n\n The Confederation is on the precipice of greatness, and unity but also on precipice of chaos, and internal conflict."
