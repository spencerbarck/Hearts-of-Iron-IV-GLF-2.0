 GLF_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Great Lakes Confederation of tribes is isolated, landlocked, and divided. During the Great War chief Nixkamich attacked Canada and the United States, a bloodless coup ended the hawkist regime of Nixkamich and replaced him with his peaceful brother Kah-ge-ga-gah-bowh. Nixkamich was imprisoned in Canada and Canadian companies now take resources from tribal lands as part of the peace treaty. \n\n The Confederation is on the precipice of greatness, and unity but also on precipice of chaos, and internal conflict."
