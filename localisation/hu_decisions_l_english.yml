 GLF_repurpose_trade_ships_decisions_desc:0 "The Confederation has a long rich history of trade, it’s various tribes have been using rivers and lakes to trade with each other since long before the Europeans arrived. The Great Lakes are teaming with ships that stop in ports like Detroit or Chicago and then make their way up the Saint Lawrence river and out to the Atlantic. Now that the Confederation has access to the Atlantic we can utilize some of our large trading fleet to expedite the process of developing a fleet of warships."

 GLF_the_cold_peace_decisions_desc:0 "Canada was unprepared for our forces. They thought that the British could protect them but we have made great advances into Canada and have made contact with several tribes that are now free from the grip of England. As we become more and more successful the British and commonwealth forces protecting Canada grow weary of this war as do the citizens of the British isles. If we are able to show enough strength the Allies will decide that this war is not worth the cost for them any more and will choose to recognize our Confederation as the rightful citizens of this land."
